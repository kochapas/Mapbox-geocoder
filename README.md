## Mapbox Geocoder 🗺 📍

This is part of mapbox project while I was learning full-stack course at Le Wagon. Basically they just want us to call the mapbox geocoder api and show a string of center coordinate on the plain webpage in [long, lat] format (map drawing ✏ is optional). Then I decided to change some css to make it look prittier and show all the map inside carousel, the problem is the carousel and mapbox seems to hate each other and the work around to resize mapbox is quite a pain.
